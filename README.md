# Just-Memes
Just Memes is an android app that I built as a fun project.THe app uses clean architecture and mvvm pattern.
The app fetches meems from firebase firestore and dislays them as either a Storyview(like facebook stories) or just a normal gridview.

# Architecture
I used clean architecture and mvvm repository pattern.

# Libraries
- Firebase Firestore

- Glide
- Splashscreen API
